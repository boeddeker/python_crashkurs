To ensure that we will be able to share the correct project for, please change your First Name in CoCalc according to the following naming conventions and
course abbreviations:
- SML: Statistical and Machine Learning
- DSSP: Digital Speech Signal Processing / Digitale Sprachsignalverarbeitung
- WCOM:  Wireless Communication
- ZDSV:  Zeitdiskrete Signalverarbeitung 

Example:
  Name: John Doe
  Course(s): DSSP, SML
  
  CoCalc user name:
