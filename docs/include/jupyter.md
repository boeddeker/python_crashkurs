> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

To start a jupyter server, just type the following in a terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook  # alternative `jupyter lab`
```

This should open a new tab in your browser.
You should see the files in the current working directory.

IPython is an extention of the python language with some special commands for Jupyter.
For example in the exercise notebooks, you will often find `%matplotlib inline`.
This activates the `inline` plotting backend for jupyter.
