# Remote: CoCalc

(Wikipedia)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoCalc]: 
> CoCalc (formerly called SageMathCloud) is a web-based cloud computing (SaaS) and course management platform for computational mathematics.
> Part of the Sage project, it supports editing of Sage worksheets, LaTeX documents and Jupyter notebooks. 
> CoCalc runs an Ubuntu Linux environment that can be interacted with through a terminal, additionally giving access to most of the capabilities of Linux.
> 
> CoCalc offers both free and paid accounts.
> Subscriptions starting at $14/month provide internet access and more storage and computing resources.
> One subscription can be used to increase quotas for one project used by multiple accounts.
> There are subscription plans for courses. Over 200 courses have used CoCalc.


For remote programming exercises we decided to use CoCalc.
We have our own server. Ask your tutor for the URL and the token (Required to create an account).
So you don't have to pay anything.

 - Open the URL.
 - Click Sign In
 - Fill `Create an Account`
   - Note: Our CoCalc doesn't send email, hence you will not get a confirmation mail.
   - Use the lecture name as prefix of your first name (e.g. `[SML] Max`). That reduces the workload of your tutor to create a project. When you visit multiple lecture, you can use something like `[SML][DSSP] Max`.

## FAQ

Q: When I open a Notebook, it asks `Select a Kernel`
A: Simply select the suggested kernel `Python 3 (Ubuntu Linux)`

Q: What is a kernel?
A: The kernel could be interpreted as the executer of the notebook. Everything that should be executed is send to the kernel. There are options for different Python installations, but also for other laguages `R` or `Octave`.
