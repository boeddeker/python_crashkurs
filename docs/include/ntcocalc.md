For remote programming exercises we decided to use CoCalc. 
We have our own server. Therefore, the service is completely free of charges. but to use this server you are still
required to create an account. 
Look up the URL and registration token in the online couse management (Panda) or ask your tutor if you occur any problems.

Step by step registration:
 - Open the URL.
 - Click *Sign In*
 - Fill `Create an Account`
   - Note: Our CoCalc server doesn't send a confirmation email, your account will directly be appoved after registration.
   - Use the lecture name as prefix of your first name (e.g. `[SML] Max`). That ensures your tutor will be able to invite you to the correct projects.
   -  If you visit multiple lecture, you can use something like `[SML][DSSP] Max`.

## FAQ
